            <p>Hi, I’m Jackie. I’ve been working as a software engineer for about a year and half now. I originally started my career as an industrial engineer and made a career switch into development. Here is my journey. </p>
            <p>I attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison for my undergrad in industrial engineering. My first co-op as an engineer was at a small company that made embedded computer hardware, where I spent a lot of time with people that programmed all day. This is where I first became curious about the computer science field. I had to learn HTML one of my first days on the job so I could write documentation for their quality program and add it to their internal wiki system. Once I got back to school the following semester, I decided to add on a computer science certificate to my major. I really enjoyed my programming classes, but I was almost done with my industrial engineering degree and didn’t feel that switching majors was a practical option. So, I graduated with my B.S. in industrial engineering and accepted a full time position as part of a two year rotational program at SPX. I completed rotations in continuous improvement, industrial engineering, and strategic sourcing before taking a full time role there as an industrial engineer.</p>
            <p>At this point in my career, I wasn't sure where I saw myself going next. I missed the challenges, learning, and problem solving that I experienced while programming. So, I made the decision to return to school part time for a full degree in computer science at Oregon State University through their online post-baccalaureate program. I completed the program over two years while working full time, which involved spending most of my nights and weekends studying and coding. During my summer break, I accepted a position at FedEx SmartPost, where I worked for three and a half years. In this role, I continued to gain valuable engineering experience, which I hope to apply to a more technical role in the future. I left FedEx in 2018 to complete a thru-hike of the Pacific Crest Trail, another long term goal of mine. Upon my return, it was finally time to make the switch! I accepted a position at a small company as a software engineer making SaaS applications for logistics. I get to apply my prior business expertise while working as a full stack developer writing in Java, Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, and Angular. I love constantly learning and the new challenges each day provides!</p>
            <p>When I’m not working, I enjoy a variety of hobbies including rock climbing, hiking, running, photography, and traveling.</p>
