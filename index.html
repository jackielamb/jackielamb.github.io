        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jackie. I have almost 6 years of experience working as an industrial engineer and am working to switch careers into the computer science field. I have a B.S. in industrial engineering and a B.S. in computer science. Here is my journey.</p>
        <p>I attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison for my undergrad in industrial engineering. My first co-op as an engineer was at a small company that made embedded computer hardware, so it was me and a bunch of guys who programmed all day. This is where I first became curious about the computer science field. My main role there was to write the documentation for their quality program and to ensure they were compliant to ISO 9001. I had to learn HTML one of my first days on the job so I could write their documents into their internal wiki system. Once I got back to school the following semester, I decided to add on a computer science certificate to my major. I really enjoyed my programming classes, but I was so far along in my current major as an industrial engineer that I didn't want to switch majors. So I graduated with my B.S. in industrial engineering and got a full time position as part of a two year rotational program. I completed the program, doing rotations in continuous improvement, industrial engineering, and strategic sourcing. I then took a full time role there as an industrial engineer.</p>
        <p>At this point in my career, I wasn't sure where I saw myself going next. I always had very good reviews up to this point, but I never really felt like I enjoyed what I was doing. Most of my days involved spending far too much time doing simple repetitive tasks and not enough time analyzing and solving problems. I spent a few months researching what I wanted to do next and came to the conclusion to get a full computer science degree through Oregon State's post baccalaureate program. I completed the program over two years while working full time. It was 60 credits of computer science classes. Most quarters I was taking two classes at a time, so I spent all my nights and weekends studying and programming. After about a year into the program, I took the summer quarter off from school. I decided to switch roles and look for a new job in the Milwaukee area as an industrial engineer. I searched for a position with a slightly different company culture, where I would hopefully be more engaged and challenged in a new way. I applied for a few positions and accepted a role as a transportation engineer. I didn’t enjoy my new role as much as I hoped so within a year, I took a hub engineering position within the same company that I have been enjoying since. Meanwhile, I finished my degree in computer science from Oregon State, but didn’t feel this was the best time to switch to a new career. I am now considering what I want to do next and I think now is a good point in my life to finally make a career switch to computer science.</p>
        <p>While I’m not working, I enjoy a variety of hobbies. A few years back I tried rock climbing for the first time, and have been hooked since. Rock climbing is just another form of problem solving to find the correct technique to utilize your physical strength and dexterity to climb a wall all while overcoming the mental barrier of fear. Climbing at the gym has been a great way to train, but I always look forward to spending the weekend top roping and anchor building at Devil’s Lake State Park in WI or sport climbing at Jackson Falls, IL. When I’m trying to give my fingers a break, I enjoy running half marathons and marathons and find running to be a great escape from the stresses of life.  I also enjoy playing board games, backpacking, traveling, landscape photography, skiing, and scuba diving.</p>
