        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I’m Jackie. I have 7 years of experience working as an industrial engineer and am working to switch careers into the computer science field. I have a B.S. in industrial engineering and a B.S. in computer science. Here is my journey.</p>
        <p>I attended the University of Wisconsin - Madison for my undergrad in industrial engineering. My first co-op as an engineer was at a small company that made embedded computer hardware, where I spent a lot of time with people that programmed all day. This is where I first became curious about the computer science field. I had to learn HTML one of my first days on the job so I could write documentation for their quality program and add it to their internal wiki system. Once I got back to school the following semester, I decided to add on a computer science certificate to my major. I really enjoyed my programming classes, but I was almost done with my industrial engineering degree and didn’t feel that switching majors was a practical option. So, I graduated with my B.S. in industrial engineering and accepted a full time position as part of a two year rotational program at SPX. I completed rotations in continuous improvement, industrial engineering, and strategic sourcing before taking a full time role there as an industrial engineer.</p>
		<p>At this point in my career, I wasn't sure where I saw myself going next. I missed the challenges, learning, and problem solving that I experienced in school. So, I made the decision to return to school part time for a full degree in computer science at Oregon State University through their online post-baccalaureate program. I completed the program over two years while working full time, which involved spending most of my nights and weekends studying and coding. During my summer break, I accepted a position at FedEx SmartPost, where I have been working since. In this role, I have continued to gain valuable engineering experience, which I hope to apply to a more technical role in the future. I find coding to be like solving lots of mini puzzles, which is both challenging and rewarding. I look forward to using these skills in my future career.</p>
		<p>When I’m not working, I enjoy a variety of hobbies including rock climbing, running, photography, and traveling.</p>
