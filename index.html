        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, I'm Jackie. I originally earned a Bachelors of Science in Industrial Engineering and a certificate in Computer Science at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. During my internships as well as my first full time position at SPX, I was able to move from trainee to contributing team member quickly. However, I found the work much less engaging than I’d hoped. I’ve always liked problem solving and learning new things, and I’d really enjoyed the programming classes I’d taken, so I made the decision to go back to school for a full degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University. Meanwhile, I also decided to give Industrial Engineering one last shot, so I accepted a position at FedEx, where I have been working since.  While the inherent challenges involved in switching companies and industries hooked me for a time, this experience has reaffirmed my decision to pursue another career entirely.</p>
        <p>While earning my computer science degree, I worked on a variety of software projects. My favorite involved designing an Android Application for a recycling company near the university. I designed the whole front end of the app, while my teammates designed the relational database, the API, and the website used to maintain the database.  I chose the front end for two main reasons: it gave me experience in user interface design, and it allowed me to hone my skills in Java, which was the first programming language I learned at UW. Another notable project involved designing a website that allowed users to upload, store, and view photos, as it combined HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript. Aside from the obvious programming experience these projects gave me, they also allowed me to further develop my problem solving skills and my ability to work with a team.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy rock climbing, running, playing board games, and adventuring.</p>
